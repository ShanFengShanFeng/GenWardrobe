## Getting Started
### Key Steps for Realistic Dressing
1. Add your API_KEY in [config.py](config.py).
2. Start the backend with Flask to receive POST requests for generation.
3. Front-end and back-end interaction with user photo and scene description upload on the Front-end.
4. Run [app.py](app.py) to execute the entire pipeline.

## Demo
- To showcase the end-to-end workflow of the system, we built an interactive demonstration, where the raw user input consists of a full-body photo and a travel plan text. The demonstration outputs both a pure fashion wardrobe and visualized fashion wardrobe.


## Evaluation
- To validate the professionalism and practicality of the generated recommendations, we conducted a double-blind expert evaluation experiment. Six experts in the field of fashion design were invited to anonymously evaluate two sets of outfit recommendation images: those generated by the proposed system and those produced without using it. The evaluation was conducted using a combination of pairwise comparison and anchored rating scales.
### Test Input
- To verify the effectiveness of the system across different task scenarios, we tested a variety of input cases, as listed below:
1. General Travel Scenario
- Example: I plan to travel to Phuket in early May. Please recommend suitable outfits, preferably in a casual style.
2. Formal Event Scenario
- Example: I have a business meeting in Singapore in June. Please recommend appropriate attire for a formal indoor setting.
3. Leisure and Outdoor Activity Scenario
- Example: I plan to visit a park to enjoy the flowers this weekend. Please recommend some suitable outfits.
4. Daily/Commuting Scenario
- Example: Please recommend an outfit suitable for daily commuting in summer in Shanghai.
5. Multi-task Scenario
- Example: I will travel to Bali in July for about three days, and then attend a wedding in London. Please recommend outfits for both occasions.
### Evaluation Metrics
- To ensure the accuracy of the evaluation, we invited experts in the fashion field to develop corresponding evaluation scales and methods, as shown in the figure below.

### Results
- The average score across all comparisons was +1.146 (indicating a preference between ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù), and statistical analysis confirmed a significant advantage in both aesthetic quality and contextual relevance.
